# ðŸ”¹ Login API (REST)

A simple yet powerful RESTful API built for user authentication and registration, using Node.js, JavaScript, and MongoDB. Designed with the MVC architecture to keep things clean and organized. This API allows users to sign up, store their credentials securely in the database, and authenticate via login.

Note: Remember to set your environment variables in .env and update your database connection URL in app.js. Because, obviously, hardcoding your credentials is so 2010.
